        ##Getting Started

        Choose a modern web browser, like [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/), that supports current web standards and has good development tools.

        You can write code using your computer's default text editor, Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Apple), but choosing a text editor with colour highlighting and other helpful features will improve your work flow.

        There are many free and paid options like [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) or [Atom](https://atom.io).  
        Today, we're going to use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). 

        Improve your work flow with [keyboard shortcuts](shortcuts-cheatsheet.html). TODO

        ##Anatomy of a Web Page

        **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is used to define the meaning of the content, known as [semantics](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/) and to create the structure of the page.

        **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the presentation layer used to define how the page will look (e.g. colours, fonts, etc).

        **JavaScript** is a programming language. This is usually used to defines the behaviour and interactions. (e.g. when the user scrolls down the page, do something)

      ##HTML / XHTML / HTML5

What's the difference?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**:  Used to structure and define page content.

**XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language)**: Reformed HTML based on XML. Syntax rules are more strict.

**HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language, revision 5)**: Most current version. Improved the support for multimedia and introduced new structural tags. Not supported in older browsers.

Basically, these three terms refer to different versions of the same language but are often just called HTML interchangeably.

The [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) (W3C) governs these web standards with specifications, guidelines, tools and recommendations.

        ##HTML Terminology

        **Elements:** Components that define structural objects such as paragraphs (`p`).

        **Tags:** Used to define HTML elements. Denoted by `<`angled brackets`>` (`shift` + `,` and `shift` + `.` ) Usually come in pairs (but not always) that open to mark the beginning of an element and close the element with a forward slash. 

        ```
        <tag>content here</tag>
        ```

        Tags can also be nested inside other tags. Just make sure they always close in the reverse order.
        ```
        <p>I am a paragraph with <strong>bold text</strong>.</p>
        ```
        **Attributes:** provides additional information or instruction for the element and is included *inside* the opening HTML tag in the form of `attribute="value"`. (more on this later)

        ```
        <tag attribute="value">content</tag>

        ##Basic HTML document

        These are the basic HTML tags included on every web page. 

        ```xml
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            All page content goes here!
          </body>
        </html>
        ```
          
        **DOCTYPE** - This is always the first line because it tells the browser what version of HTML the document is written in. Can be written in lowercase or uppercase. 

        `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the doctype for HTML5 (the latest version of HTML).

        Here's what the previous version's doctype (XHTML) looks like.  HTML5 is much neater!

        ```
        <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
        ```
         
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Basic HTML document

        ```xml
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            All page content goes here!
          </body>
        </html>
        ```
        **&lt;html>** - Identifies the document as HTML. The `lang="en"` attribute is optional but recommended since it classifies the language and can be used for translation tools and improve quality of search results.

        **&lt;head>** - Contains info about the current page (more on this later). `<title>` must be included to define the page title. This is displayed in the browser toolbar, bookmarks and search engine results.

        **&lt;body>** - All content to be displayed in the browser window, also known as the viewport, goes here.

        Note the indentation of the code.  Every nested element becomes a descendant element, creating a family tree-like structure of parent/child nodes, siblings, anscestors and descendants.

        ## Setting Up Your Work Flow 

        ```xml
        llc-html-css-half-day-master
          |-- framework (folder) // Contains files needed for this slide presentation. Do not edit!
          |-- project (folder) // All the project files needed for today go in here
          |-- slides.html // This is the file you are viewing right now. Do not edit!
        ```

        For many basic commands (open, save, copy, etc), refer to your <!-- .element: class="footnote" -->[keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet](shortcuts-cheatsheet.html) or follow the instructions below.

        1. Open Sublime Text and go to **File > Open**.
        1. Navigate to the **project** folder, highlight it and select **Open**.
        1. Open **index.html** by double clicking on the file to open your starter project file.
        1. Right-click/two-finger tap anywhere on the file and select **Open in Browser** to open the HTML file in your *default* browser.
        1. Update the line `<h1>Your Name here</h1>`, save the file & refresh the browser. 

        This is your editing workflow. 

        See the difference between what you see in the editor and browser? Let&#39;s talk more about HTML tags.

        If Chrome is not your default browser, go to your Window/Finder and navigate to the<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> **project** folder, right-click/two-finger tap on **index.html** and choose **Open With > Chrome**

        To create a web page, files are name with an <!-- .element: class="footnote" -->**.html** extension (just like .pdf for PDF files or .doc for Word files). It&#39;s good practice to name your home page as **index.html** because your web server maps to this file as its default page.

        ##Planning the page layout

        An important part of creating a web page is planning how to structure the page.  Though you will likely make changings as you go along, creating a basic structural layout with *semantic* markup is a good way to start.

        If you don't have a design to work from, many developers and designers like to start planning with a simple sketch. But for today, let's take a look at the final design to see how to group related elements and create a page structure.

        There are many *structural HTML tags* that are used just for this purpose.

        ![final design sections](framework/img/workshop/project-final-sections.jpg)
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Structural HTML tags

        The `<div>` tag is one of two HTML tags that has no semantic meaning. (`<span>` is the other.) It is used purely for grouping elements together for styling.

        `<div>` tags are often used with the `class` attribute to differentiate them (more on `class` later).  To create the page layout, the HTML could look something like this:

        ```xml
        <div class="nav">
          nav links here
        </div>

        <div class="header">
          header content here
        </div>

        <div class="about">
          about content here
        </div>

        <div class="extras">
          extra content here
        </div>

        <div class="footer">
          footer & contact info here
        </div>
        ```

        Be careful of "divitis"! Use the <!-- .element: class="footnote" -->`<div>` to *group* related elements to be styled together as one section. If you need to style a single element, like an `<h1>` for example, just style that element directly. The browser sees every element as a "box" so there&#39;s no need to put a box around a box!
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##HTML5 Structural Elements

        In HTML5, new semantic tags were introduced to better describe blocks of content such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>` and `<section>`. Using HTML5 tags, the previous example could look like this instead:

        ```xml
        <nav>
          nav links here
        </nav>

        <header>
          header content here
        </header>

        <section class="about">
          about content here
        </section>

        <section class="extras">
          extra content here
        </section>

        <footer>
          footer & contact info here
        </footer>
        ```
        
        `<div>` can still be used when no other tag properly describes the element. When in doubt, it&#39;s ok to continue to use `<div>`.

        ##Class Exercise #2: Page structure

        Without peeking at the previous slide, let&#39;s go into our text editor and add the general page layout using semantic HTML5 tags.

        We will need to add a nav, header, about section, extras section and the contact/footer.

        We can also use HTML comments to help organize the content.  The syntax is:

      <script type="text/template">
        ##Paragraphs & Headings
        
        Every new paragraph, whether it&#39;s one sentence or more, needs its own pair of `<p></p>` tags.

        ```xml
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        ```
        
        <br>
        There are six page headings tags ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. Headings are used to describe the *hierarchy* of the page structure. Think about how you would arrange an essay outline.

          **Title** (`h1`) 

          1. Introduction (`h2`) 
          1. First supporting idea (`h2`)
            * point 1 (`h3`)
            * point 2 (`h3`)
            * point 3 (`h3`)
          1. Second supporting idea (`h2`)
            * point 1 (`h3`)
            * point 2 (`h3`)
          1. Conclusion (`h2`)

          ##Headings & HTML5 Sectioning tags

          Prior to HTML5, generally only one `<h1>` was used per page.  With the introduction of HTML5 sectioning tags, each part of the document that uses a sectioning tag now gets its *own* outline.

          Read more about headings and HTML5<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document) and [here](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/the-truth-about-multiple-h1-tags-in-the-html5-era--webdesign-16824).

        Add in some basic content listed in the instructions below.  Your page will look similar to this:

        Example:<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> [project/examples/basic-html.html](project/examples/basic-html.html)

        1. Add your name in the `<header>` section if you haven&#39;t already. (Leave the navigation blank for now.)
        1. In the **About** section, add a heading and a couple paragraphs.
        1. Add a quote/heading into the **Extras** section.
        1. In the **Footer**, add a heading and a paragraph.

        <div class="footnote">
          Don&#39;t know what content to add? Use placeholder text!

        ## Links / Anchor tag

        Links (hyperlinks) are represented by the anchor (`<a>`) tag. It also needs an `href` attribute to provide additional information, in this case, where the link should go to.

        #####Link to an external site
        ```xml
        <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code</a>
        ```
        
        #####Link to other HTML pages
        ```xml
        <a href="about.html">About page</a>
        ```

        #####Link to a specific spot on a page
        Add an `id` attribute to the tag where you would like the link to go to. In the `href` attribute value, use the `#` symbol followed by the id name, with no spaces.
        ```xml
        <a href="#linkSpot">Click this link to navigate to a spot on the page</a>
        ```
        ```xml
        <h2 id="linkSpot">This where you want the link to go TO.</h2>
        ```

        #####LINK TO A SPECIFIC SPOT ON Another page
        ```xml
        <a href="about.html#linkSpot">Click this link to navigate to a spot on the page</a>
        ```

        #####Set link to open in a new window
        Add an second attribute, `target`.
        ```xml
        <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com" target="_blank">Ladies Learning Code</a>
        ```

        #####Set an email link
        ```xml
        <a href="mailto:hello@myemail.com">hello@myemail.com</a>

        ##Exercise #2: Add links and navigation (10mins)

        Even though we&#39;re building a one-page website, we can still create a navigation and set the links to different parts of the page.

        1. In the `<nav>` section, add three links (Home, About, Contact) - they should link to the specific part of the matching page content. Hint! You&#39;ll need to use the `id` attribute.  
          <span class="footnote">(If you get stuck, refer to the previous slide for examples or ask a mentor!)</span>
        1. Add some links within your paragraphs.  You can nest the `<a>` tags within the `<p>` tags and just surround the text that you want show as a link.

          ```xml
          <p><a href="http://hbo.com/the-wire" target="_blank">Link example</a> in a paragraph.</p>
          <p>Another paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolo sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit laboriosam officia.</p>
          ```
          We currently don&#39;t have much content so the page links won&#39;t jump to the page section if the content isn&#39;t long enough to scroll down. Either, minimize the height of your browser or test it again when we add more content and styles.  It should look something like this:

          ![](framework/img/workshop/exercise-4.gif)
        1. Add your email link in the footer section.

          ##CSS overview

          CSS is a stylesheet language with its own syntax rules. It separates content from presentation. A style sheet contains a list of style rules.

          **Selectors:** used to determine which HTML element(s) to apply the styles to.  
          **Declarations:** style rules, written using `property:value` pairs, are wrapped by curly brackets `{}` and each must end with a semi-colon `;` to indicate that the instruction is complete.

          ```css
          selector {
            property: value;
          }
          ```

          **Properties** determine the type of style to be applied to the element (e.g. color). Values are specific to the property (red). The following example below changes the font colour of all paragraphs to red.

          ```css
          p {
            color: red;
          }
          ```

        ##Referencing CSS

        There are several ways to include CSS in an HTML page. Today we&#39;ll be using the **external** method which links to a separate style sheet file (uses a `.css` file extension) to separate the CSS from the HTML document.

        The style sheet is referenced in the `<head>` of the document with a `<link>` tag and two **attributes**, `rel` (relationship) and `href`. The value of `href` points to the file location of the style sheet. 

        Though not required, css files are often saved in a separate css folder for organization, so make sure the file path points to the appropriate directory.
        ```
        <head>
          <title>Page Title</title>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
        </head>
        ```

        ##Create a CSS File

        Back in Sublime Text, create a new CSS file by selecting **File > New File** or use a [keyboard shortcut](shortcuts-cheatsheet.html). Name the file with a **.css** extension. Let&#39;s call it **styles.css** and add it to **index.html**.

        <p class="footnote">**PRO TIP!** Sublime Text has a shortcut.  Type "link" with no brackets, then the tab key. Voila!</p>

        ##Background images

        The `background` property can be used to add colours or background images. There are two ways to declare the `background` property. The value must inclue the file path to the the image file.

        ```css
        /* shorthand */
        background: url(path/to/image/file);
        ```
        ```css
        /* longhand */
        background-image: url(path/to/image/file);
        ```

        **Important:** Note the location of the CSS file.  Since it&#39;s inside of a folder, we need to adjust the file path to reflect that, using `../` to indicate that the directory needs to move *up* and *out* of the containing folder.

        ```css
        background: url(../path/to/image/file);
        ```

        ##Default HTML styles
        
        HTML comes with default styles such as different heading sizes, font weights and sizes as well as default *spacing*.  Notice the space between the paragraphs and headings? This can be changed with CSS.

        The browser looks at every HTML element on the page as a rectangular/square box. The **CSS Box Model** describes the way CSS styles the size and spacing of HTML elements.

        There are some funny quirks with the box model sizing.  In short, adding the CSS snippet below to your CSS file will fix those quirks. See more about The Box Model [here](http://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/).

        ```
        /* apply a natural box layout model to all elements, but allowing components to change */
        html {
          box-sizing: border-box;
        }
        *, *:before, *:after {
          box-sizing: inherit;
        }

        ##Margin and Padding

        `margin` - adds/removes space **outside** of the element  
        `padding` - adds/removes space **inside** of the element  

        The values for both properties can be declared using 1 to 4 values. A variety of measurement units can be used but today we will use pixels. Setting the value to "0" will *remove* any default space and any positive value will *add* space.

        ```css
        padding: 2px 10px 2px 10px; /* top, right, bottom, left */
        padding: 2px 10px 2px; /* top, right & left, bottom */
        padding: 2px 10px; /* top & bottom, right and left */
        padding: 2px /* all sides have the same value */
        ```

        Both margin and padding can also be used by targeting a specific side.

        ```css
        margin-top: 2px;
        margin-right: 2px;
        margin-bottom: 2px;
        margin-left: 2px;

        Notice that the content doesn&#39;t quite go to the edge of the page? 

        ![](framework/img/workshop/exercise-spacing.png)

        That&#39;s because there&#39;s default spacing in the `body` element (as well as many other elements). Remove the test background color and replace it with `padding` and `margin` to reset the value. Save and check the changes in the browser.

        ```
        body {
          padding: 0;
          margin: 0;

          padding: 150px 0; /* top & bottom, left & right */

        ##Class Exercise #5: Background Images, Part 2

        If the image is smaller than the width of your browser window, the image will repeat by default.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/exercise-8-bgrepeat.jpg)

        Let's add three more values: `no-repeat`, `fixed` and `cover`.   Let's add this to our project, one value at a time, to see what each one does. Try scrolling and minimizing and maximizing your browser window!

        The end code will look like this:
        
        ```
        header { /* longhand */
          background-image: url(../images/baltimore-rowhouses.jpg);
          background-repeat: no-repeat;
          background-attachment: fixed;
          background-size: cover;
        }
        ```
        ```
        header { /* shorthand */
          background: url(../images/baltimore-rowhouses.jpg) no-repeat fixed;
          background-size: cover;
        }
        ```

        Note that <!-- .element: class="footnote" -->`background-size` is the longhand property. To include it in the shorthand style, it **must** be included after `background-position`, separated with the `/` character. If no background position value is used, background-size won’t work in the shorthand style so in this case, it may be less error prone to just add it via the longhand property.

        ##Inheritance and Specificity

        One of the strengths of CSS is styles can be inherited from parent to child elements using the family tree relationship between the elements.

        ```
        <body>
          <h1>My Website</h1><!-- child of body -->
          <p>This is a paragraph.</p><!-- sibling of h1 -->
        </body>
        ```
        ```
        body {
          color: blue;
          font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        h1 {
          color: black;
        }
        ```

        In the above example, the CSS properties in the body selector is inherited by the descendants elements (all nested elements). All text will be blue and display the Helvetica font. However, when a more specific selector is used (e.g. `h1`), it overrides the inherited values because it&#39;s more *specific*.

        ##Using Google Fonts

        Services like [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) make it easier to add variety to your font choices. Google Fonts allows you to link directly to their hosted files making it available to all users that visit your site.

        1. Select the fonts you want to use and **Add to Collection**.<br>
          <span class="footnote">(The LLC project uses Roboto and Satisfy. Some other good ones are Open Sans and Pacifico.)</span>
        1. You can **Review** them to take a closer look, then choose **Use** when ready.
        1. Select font weights. The more you choose, the more it will slow down page load time.
        The default character set should contain what you need. Only select an option if you need to add additional language support.
        1. Copy the `<link>` code snippet and add it the `<head>` of your page to reference the Google Font CSS.
        1. Use the new fonts with the `font-family` property as listed in the example on the Google Fonts page.

        (Make sure the Google Font stylesheet has been added to your HTML page to use the fonts on website.)<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> 

        Let&#39;s add the base font to the `body` element, so all the descendant elements can inherit this style.  You can change the `font-weight` too.

        body {
          font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
          font-weight: 300;
        }
        ```

        Now let&#39;s make all the `<h1>` headings in the page have the same styles too. 

        ```
        h1 {
          font-size: 50px;
          font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive;
        }

        ##Class Exercise: Typography (continued)

        What if you want the `h1` in the `header` to look different than all the other `h1` tags? You can use a **descendant selector** to specifically select a tag within another tag.

        ```xml
        <header id="home">
          <h1>Kima Greggs</h1>
        </header>
        ```

        ```
        h1 {
          font-size: 50px;
          font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive;
        }
        header h1 { 
          font-size: 150px;
        }
        ```

        `header h1` is more specific so it will override the `font-size` in the `h1` declaration.

        ##Descendant selectors
            
        Matches any element that is a descendant (nested tag) of the element declared before it. Note the space in *between* each selector. This is a requirement.

        ```css
        p a {
          /* targets only anchor link tags nested inside of a p tag */
        }
        ```
        **Pro tip!** Avoid going more than three levels.

        ```
        nav ul li a span {
          /* NOOOOOOOOOOO */
        }
        ```

        You can skip a level but specificity rules still apply. For example, `nav ul li a` would override `nav a` because it&#39;s more specific. 

        It&#39;s generally better to start with generic selectors and make them more specific, as needed.

          Notice how the text in the About me section spans the whole width of the browser window? We can restrict the size of it by adding the `width` property.  Eventually, we'd also like to add a background color to it as well.

          What do you think will happen when both width and background colour is applied to it?
          
          It won't be quite what we want. It will look something like this:<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

          ##Aligning Content

          The `margin` property can also be used to center align block level elements. (More about block level elements later). 

          First, a width needs to be set. Then, setting the left &amp; right values to <code>auto</code> will find the center of the page. The <code>0</code> just refers to the top and bottom value. 

          Let&#39;s try adding `width` and `margin` it below to see the changes.</p>

height: 100px;</textarea>

          <div id="margin-auto">box</div>

          The content is centered but the background colour is restricted by the width dimension because it doesn’t span the rest of the page anymore.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        ##Practice Creating a content wrapper

        Use the `<div>` tag to *wrap* the content to create a container. We can now use this container to align just the content. Then, add the background style to the outer container (`<section class="about">`).

        A<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> `div` is used because the content-wrap has no semantic meaning. We just need to put a box around the content to style it. 

        ```xml
        <section class="about">
          <div class="content-wrap">
            content to be aligned goes here

        ##Inline & Block Elements

        **Block** elements span 100% of its container and can apply sizing properties to it.    
        **Inline** elements are the same height and width of their content, does not apply sizing properties as expected and displays side by side, in a line. 

        When in doubt, put a background colour on the element and if it spans the width of the container, then it's a block element. Otherwise, it's an inline element.

          ##Class Exercise: Create a logo

          Let&#39;s create a simple logo using just CSS! 

          ![](framework/img/workshop/logo.png)

          Often, a logo is used as another option for linking back to the home page (or in a one page example, the top of the page). Let&#39;s add another home link but add a class attribute, to hook specific CSS to it. 

          ```
          <nav>
            <a class="logo" href="#home">KG</a>
            <a href="#home">Home</a>
            <a href="#about">About</a>
            <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
          </nav>
          ```
          (Another option is to just not have a "home" link as well.)<!-- .element: class="footnote" -->
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Create a logo (continued)

        1. Style the text.  Change the `font-family` and `font-size`. What selector should we use?
          <div class="delayed">
          <pre><code>.logo {
              font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive;
              font-size: 28px;
          }
          </pre></code>
          </div>
        1. Add a border around the initals. Use <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->`border-radius` to make it rounded. 
          <div class="delayed">
          <pre><code>border: 2px solid #8c9d87;
          border-radius: 50%;
          </pre></code>
          </div>
        1. If you want the logo to be a perfect circle, add the same value to height and width. Set padding to 0 to override the padding values set for the other nav links. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
          <div class="delayed">
          <pre><code>height: 70px;
          width: 70px;
          padding: 0;
          </pre></code>
          </div>
        1. Vertically align the initials in the circle. One way to achieve this is to set the<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->`line-height` to the same value as your `height` value. Then, set the text to center align to align it horizontally. 

          <div class="delayed">
          <pre><code>line-height: 70px;
          text-align: center;
          </pre></code>
          </div>

          ##Intro to CSS Floats and Positioning

          In HTML, elements stack on top of each other in the order of how it is written.
          ```
          <p>element 1</p>
          <p>element 2</p>
          <p>element 3</p>
          ```
          renders as:
          <div class="example">
            <p>element 1</p>
            <p>element 2</p>
            <p>element 3</p>
          </div>

          In order to move elements outside of the default stacking order, we can use CSS floats or positioning.  Both of these concepts are the more complicated parts of CSS and require much more discussion.  

          Here are two indepth tutorials/articles [here](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/positioning-content/) and [here](http://spyrestudios.com/css-in-depth-floats-positions/).

      <script type="text/template">
          ##Final stretch!

          For our last exercise we&#39;re going to align the logo to the left and create a fixed nav.

          First up, the logo.  Float it to the left and add some margin to move it away from the edge of the page.

          ```css
          .logo {
            float: left;
            margin: 8px;
          }
          ```

          Next up, the nav. Use `fixed` positioning so it can stay in one spot when the page scrolls (just like the background images).

          ```css
          nav {
            position: fixed;
          }
          ```

          By default, when using positioning, the element automatically becomes the width of its content.  That&#39;s why it looks like this: 

          ![](framework/img/workshop/position-fixed.png)

          When using `position`, it also unlocks 4 position specific properties: `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left`.  For our nav, we want it to be at the top of the page, all the way to the left and stretch all the way to the right.  

          Update the nav css to:
          
          ```css
          nav {
            position: fixed;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            right: 0; /* or set width: 100% */
          }
          ```

        ###Lists 

        Ordered Lists are used for a items that should be displayed in a specific, numbered order. Two tags are required, (`<ol>`) and (`<li>`) to create the list. You can only put content within the `li` tags (list item), **not** the `ol` (ordered list). 

        ```xml
        <p>My top 5 tv shows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The Wire</li>
          <li>Breaking Bad</li>
          <li>Homeland</li>
          <li>House of Cards</li>
          <li>Game of Thrones</li>
        </ol>
        ```

        Renders as:
        <div class="example">
          <p>My top 5 tv shows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The Wire</li>
            <li>Breaking Bad</li>
            <li>Game of Thrones</li>
            <li>House of Cards</li>
            <li>Homeland</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        Unordered lists are similar but start with the unordered list tag (`<ul>`). This list of items do not depend on any specific order.

        ```xml
        <ul>
          <li>Home</li>
          <li>Portfolio</li>
          <li>Blog</li>
          <li>Contact Me</li>
        </ul>
        ```

        Renders as:
        <div class="example">
          <ul>
            <li>Home</li>
            <li>Portfolio</li>

        ##Add a social media list with Icon Fonts

        For your list of links to your social media accounts and/email, use an unordered list since the order doesn&#39;t matter. Be sure to nest the links (`<a>`) *inside* of the list item (`<li>`) as well.

        Example:
        ```
        <ul class="social">
          <li><a href="mailto:me@email.com">me@email.com</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a></li>
        </ul>
        ```
        Remove the default bullet points and padding with CSS.

        ```
        .social {
          list-style-type: none;
          padding: 0;
        }
        ```

      ##Metadata

      `<meta>` tags are optional but can provide additional info about the HTML document, using different attributes. The `charset` attribute helps the browser translate computer language (bytes) into characters & symbols and is strongly recommended. Adding a description is also useful for search engine results. 

      Note that the `<meta>` tag does not require a closing tag.

      ```xml
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <title>Page Title</title>
          <meta charset="utf-8">

        </head>
        <body>
          All page content goes here!
        </body>
      </html>
