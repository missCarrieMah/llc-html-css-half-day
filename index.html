        ##Getting Started: Web Browser 

        Choose a modern web browser, like **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/)**, that supports current web standards and has good development tools.

        You can view the source of any web page by right-clicking (or two-finger tap) on *any* web page! Let's go to http://ladieslearningcode.com and view the source. That's HTML.

        **Chrome Developer tools** take it a step further and allows us to *inspect* any web page making it easier to test and debug code. The tools can be accessed in 3 ways:

        * right-click / two-finger tap on a web page and select **Inspect Element**
        * select the menu icon ![](framework/img/workshop/menu-icon-chrome.png) in the top right hand corner and select **Tools > Developer Tools**
        * keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl + Shift + I** (PC) / **Cmnd + Option + I** (Mac)

        More about dev tools:<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com <br>
        To set Chrome as your default browser, follow [these instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?hl=en).<br>
        Visit [browsehappy.com](http://browsehappy.com) for more info about modern browsers.

##Getting Started: Text editor

You can write code using your computer's default text editor, Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Apple), but choosing a text editor with colour highlighting and other helpful features will improve your work flow.

There are many free and paid [options](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTML_editors). Today, we're going to use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

        ##Anatomy of a Web Page

        **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is used to define the meaning of the content, known as [semantics](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/) and to create the structure of the page.

        **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the presentation layer used to define how the page will look (e.g. colours, fonts, etc).

        **JavaScript** is a programming language. This is usually used to defines the behaviour and interactions. (e.g. when the user scrolls down the page, do something)

      ##HTML / XHTML / HTML5

What's the difference?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**:  Used to structure and define page content.

**XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language)**: Reformed HTML based on XML. Syntax rules are more strict.

**HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language, revision 5)**: Most current version. Improved the support for multimedia and introduced new structural tags. Not supported in older browsers.

Basically, these three terms refer to different versions of the same language but are often just called HTML interchangeably.

The [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) (W3C) governs these web standards with specifications, guidelines, tools and recommendations.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##HTML Terminology

        **Elements:** Components that define structural objects such as paragraphs (`p`).

        **Tags:** Used to define HTML elements. Denoted by `<`angled brackets`>` (`shift` + `,` and `shift` + `.` ) Usually come in pairs (but not always) that open to mark the beginning of an element and close the element with a forward slash. 

        ```
        <tag>content here</tag>
        ```

        Tags can also be nested inside other tags. Just make sure they always close in the reverse order.
        ```
        <p>I am a paragraph with <strong>bold text</strong>.</p>
        ```
        **Attributes:** provides additional information or instruction for the element and is included *inside* the opening HTML tag in the form of `attribute="value"`. (more on this later)

        ```
        <tag attribute="value">content</tag>
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Basic HTML document

        These are the basic HTML tags included on every web page. 

        ```xml
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            All page content goes here!
          </body>
        </html>
        ```
          
        **DOCTYPE** - This is always the first line because it tells the browser what version of HTML the document is written in. Can be written in lowercase or uppercase. 

        `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the doctype for HTML5.

        Remember that XHTML is just an older version of HTML? Here&#39;s what the DOCTYPE looks like for XHTML:

        ```
        <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
        ```
         
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Basic HTML document

        ```xml
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <title>hiPage Title</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            All page content goes here!
          </body>
        </html>
        ```
        **&lt;html>** - Identifies the document as HTML. Ancestor of all HTML elements. The `lang="en"` attribute is optional but recommended since it classifies the language and can be used for translation tools and improve quality of search results.

        **&lt;head>** - Contains info about the current page (more on this later). `<title>` must be included and defines the page title, which is then displayed in the browser toolbar, bookmarks and search engine results.

        **&lt;body>** - All content to be displayed in the browser window, also known as the viewport, goes here.
      </script>
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
      ##Metadata

      `<meta>` tags are optional but can provide additional info about the HTML document, using different attributes. The `charset` attribute helps the browser translate computer language (bytes) into characters & symbols and is strongly recommended. Adding a description is also useful for search engine results. 

      Note that the `<meta>` tag does not require a closing tag.

      ```xml
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <title>Page Title</title>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <meta name="Description" content="Short description about your page">
        </head>
        <body>
          All page content goes here!
        </body>
      </html>
      ```

## Setting Up Your Work Flow

Inside of the folder you downloaded today (**llc-html-css**), there are many folders and files that contain different content.

```xml
llc-html-css-  TODO
  |-- framework (folder) // Contains files needed for slide presentation. Do not edit!
  |-- project (folder) // All the project files needed for today go in here
  |-- index.html // This is the file you are viewing right now. Do not edit!
```

For all of these commands (open, save, copy, etc), refer to your [keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet](shortcuts-cheatsheet.html) or follow the instructions below.

1. Open Sublime Text and go to **File > Open**.
1. Navigate to the **project** folder (inside the folder you downloaded with today's slides).  
With the entire folder selected, select **Open**. The folder will appear in the side bar.

        ##Class Exercise #1: Create your HTML page

        To create a web page, just name your file using the **.html** extension (just like .pdf for PDF files or .doc for Word files). It's good practice to name your home page as **index.html** because your web server maps to this file as its default page.

        (Remember, you can refer to your<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> [keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet](shortcuts-cheatsheet.html) for these commands.)

        1. In Sublime, select **File > New File** to create a new file.
        1. Select **File > Save** to save & name your file.  Name it **index.html** and save it in the **project** folder.
        1. Let's add all of the basic HTML tags (hint: [Slide 12](index.html#slide12)) and save your changes.
        1. Right click or two-finger tap in Sublime and select **Open in Browser** to open the HTML file in your *default* browser. 

        If Chrome is not your default browser, go to your Window/Finder and navigate to the<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> **project** folder, right-click/two-finger tap on **index.html** and choose **Open With > Chrome**

        Example for reference:<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> [project/examples/index-ex1.html](project/examples/index-ex1.html)

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Good File Naming Habits

* Use lowercase letters. (e.g. about.html instead of About.html or ABOUT.html)
* Avoid s p a c e s. Underscores (_) or dashes (-) are valid. However, dashes are generally preferred for SEO (search engine optimization). (e.g. business-hours.html instead of business hours.html - The browser will interpret it as business%20hours.html)
* Avoid symbols like # & * in your file name.
* Keep your file names concise, yet meaningful. (e.g. about.html, contact.html instead of page1.html, page2.html)

These file naming tips can be applied to any files such as images, folders, CSS, etc.

      #Page Layout
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Planning the page layout

        An important part of creating a web page is planning how to structure the page using semantic markup and getting it ready to be styled by CSS.  You will likely make changes as you go along but it makes it easier to start with a basic page layout.

        If you don't have design to work from, many developers and designers like to start planning with a simple sketch. But for today, let's take a look at the final design and see how to group related elements to structure the page.

        There are many structural HTML tags that are used just for this purpose.

        ![final design sections](framework/img/workshop/project-final-sections.jpg)
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Structural HTML tags

        The `<div>` tag is one of two HTML tags that has no semantic meaning. (`<span>` is the other.) It is used purely for grouping elements to create sections for laying out a page.

        `<div>` tags are often used with the `class` attribute to differentiate them (more on this later).  To create the page layout, the HTML could look something like this:

        ```xml
        <div class="nav">
          nav links here
        </div>

        <div class="header">
          header content here
        </div>

        <div class="about">
          about content here
        </div>

        <div class="extras">
          extra content here
        </div>

        <div class="footer">
          footer & contact info here
        </div>
        ```

        Be careful of "divitis"! Use the <!-- .element: class="footnote" -->`<div>` to *group* related elements to be styled together as one section. If you need to style a single element, like an `<h1>` for example, just style that element directly. The browser sees every element as a "box" so there&#39;s no need to put a box around a box!
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##HTML5 Structural Elements

        In HTML5, new semantic tags were introduced to better describe blocks of content such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>` and `<section>`. Using HTML5 tags, the previous example could look like this instead:

        ```xml
        <nav>
          nav links here
        </nav>

        <header>
          header content here
        </header>

        <section class="about">
          about content here
        </section>

        <section class="extras">
          extra content here
        </section>

        <footer>
          footer & contact info here
        </footer>
        ```
        
        `<div>` can still be used when no other tag properly describes the element. When in doubt, it&#39;s ok to continue to use `<div>`.

        ##Class Exercise #2: Page structure

        Without peeking at the previous slide, let&#39;s go into our text editor and add the general page layout using semantic HTML5 tags.

        We will need to add a nav, header, about section, extras section and the contact/footer.

        We can also use HTML comments to help organize the content.  The syntax is:

        ```xml
        <!--  comment goes in between here -->
        ```

        Example for reference:<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> [project/examples/index-ex2.html](project/examples/index-ex2.html)

      <script type="text/template">
        ##Paragraphs & Headings
        
        Every new paragraph, whether it&#39;s one sentence or more, needs its own pair of `<p></p>` tags.

        ```xml
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        ```
        <br>
        There are six page headings tags ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. Headings are used to describe the *hierarchy* of the page structure. Think about how you would arrange an essay outline.

          **Title** (`h1`) 

          1. Introduction (`h2`) 
          1. First supporting idea (`h2`)
            * point 1 (`h3`)
            * point 2 (`h3`)
            * point 3 (`h3`)
          1. Second supporting idea (`h2`)
            * point 1 (`h3`)
            * point 2 (`h3`)
          1. Conclusion (`h2`)
        
        ```xml
        <h1>Title</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h2>First supporting idea</h2>
        <h3>point 1</h3>
        <h3>point 2</h3>

      <script type="text/template">
          ##Headings & HTML5 Sectioning tags

          Prior to HTML5, the rule was to only use one `<h1>` per page.  With the introduction of HTML5 sectioning tags, each part of the document that uses a sectioning tag now gets its own outline.

          Read more about headings and HTML5<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document) and [here](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/the-truth-about-multiple-h1-tags-in-the-html5-era--webdesign-16824).

        <a href="about.html">About page</a>
        ```

        #####Link to a specific spot on a page
        Add an `id` attribute to the tag where you would like the link to go to. In the `href` attribute value, use the `#` symbol followed by the id name, with no spaces.
        ```xml
        <a href="#linkSpot">Click this link to navigate to a spot on the page</a>
        ```
        ```xml
        <h2 id="linkSpot">This where you want the link to go TO.</h2>
        ```

        #####LINK TO A SPECIFIC SPOT ON Another page
        ```xml
        <a href="about.html#linkSpot">Click this link to navigate to a spot on the page</a>
        ```

        #####Set link to open in a new window
        Add an second attribute, `target`.
        ```xml
        <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com" target="_blank">Ladies Learning Code</a>
        ```

        ##Exercise #4: Add links and navigation (10mins)

        Even though we&#39;re building a one-page website, we can still create a navigation and set the links to different parts of the page.

        1. In the `<nav>` section, add three links (Home, About, Contact) - they should link to the specific part of the matching page content. Hint! You&#39;ll need to use the `id` attribute.  
          <span class="footnote">(If you get stuck, refer to the previous slide for examples or ask a mentor!)</span>
        1. Add some links within your paragraphs.  You can nest the `<a>` tags within the `<p>` tags and just surround the text that you want show as a link.

        ```xml
        <p><a href="http://hbo.com/the-wire" target="_blank">Link example</a> in a paragraph.</p>
        <p>Another paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolo sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit laboriosam officia.</p>
        ```
        We currently don&#39;t have much content so the in page links won&#39;t jump to the page section if the content isn&#39;t long enough to scroll. Either, minimize the height of your browser or test it again when we add more content and styles.  It should look something like this:

        ![](framework/img/workshop/exercise-4.gif)

        ##Lists 

        Ordered Lists are used for a items that should be displayed in a specific, numbered order. Two tags are required, (`<ol>`) and (`<li>`) to create the list. You can only put content within the `li` tags (list item), **not** the `ol` (ordered list). 

        ```xml
        <p>My top 5 tv shows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The Wire</li>
          <li>Breaking Bad</li>
          <li>Homeland</li>
          <li>House of Cards</li>
          <li>Game of Thrones</li>
        </ol>
        ```

        Renders as:
        <div class="example">
          <p>My top 5 tv shows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The Wire</li>
            <li>Breaking Bad</li>
            <li>Game of Thrones</li>
            <li>House of Cards</li>
            <li>Homeland</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        Unordered lists are similar but start with the unordered list tag (`<ul>`). This list of items do not depend on any specific order.

        ```xml
        <ul>
          <li>Home</li>
          <li>Portfolio</li>
          <li>Blog</li>
          <li>Contact Me</li>
        </ul>
        ```

        Renders as:
        <div class="example">
          <ul>
            <li>Home</li>
            <li>Portfolio</li>
            <li>Blog</li>
            <li>Contact Me</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        ## Links / Anchor tag

        Links (hyperlinks) are represented by the anchor (`<a>`) tag. An `attribute` is required to provide more information, in the case, the `href` attribute, to specify the link location.

        #####Link to an external site

        ```xml
        <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code</a>
        ```

        #####Link to other HTML pages

        ```xml
        <a href="about.html">About page</a>
        ```

        #####Link to a specific spot on a page

        Add an `id` attribute to the tag where you would like the link to go to. In the `href` attribute value, use the `#` symbol followed by the id name, with no spaces.

        ```xml
        <a href="#linkSpot">Click this link to navigate to a spot on the page</a>
        ```
        ```xml
        <h2 id="linkSpot">This where you want the link to go TO.</h2>

## Exercise #1 - Adding content (10 mins)

In the Sublime Text editor:

1. Update the `&lt;title>&lt;/title>`
1. Add your name in the `h1` tag if you haven’t already.
1. Add your tag line under your name using the appropriate heading tag.
1. Change the content in the `title` tag. Where do you see this change?
1. Add a copyright message using a paragraph (`p`) tag _inside_ of the `footer` tag.

**Bonus:** Try using an HTML code for the copyright _symbol_. Here are some resources: 

[http://character-code.com/ascii-table.php](http://character-code.com/ascii-table.php) 
[http://unicode-table.com/en/#00A9](http://unicode-table.com/en/#00A9)

Don’t forget to save and refresh your browser after each change!

Your page should now look similar to [exercise1.html](project/examples/exercise1.html)
