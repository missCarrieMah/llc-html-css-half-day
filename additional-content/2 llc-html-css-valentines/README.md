A 3hr introductory HTML & CSS3 animations workshop.

### Contributing

This project uses [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to maintain consistent coding style. Make sure your text editor has an editorconfig [plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) installed.

**Atom Users:** The Whitespace plugin (which is installed by default) has `Trim trailing whitespace` option turned on by default. Turn this off in the Whitespace plugin settings, otherwise it overwrites the setting in [.editorconfig](.editorconfig). This is a known [issue](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig/issues/3).  This is not required for workshop attendees, just for those wishing to make updates to the slides.

Please refer to https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/llc-slidedeck-template for instructions for customization of the slide deck and features. If there are any issues or fixes required for this workshop slide presentation, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
